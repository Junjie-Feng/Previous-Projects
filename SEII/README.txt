You can use both of bayesian_curve_fitting.py and data_set.cvs files to run this program in Python 2.6.9.

I chose alpha = 0.005 and beta = 11.1 as recommended in the bishop textbook. These parameters can be changed in the main function in the program.

The size of input data sets is 10 which is chosen randomly. Using an M = 9 as the polynomial curve fitting maximal oder element. 

The program will automatically calculate the results and print them out.
The result/output of the program is the predicted value of the training sets, the real data value, the absolute mean error and average relative error.
