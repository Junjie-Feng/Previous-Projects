This python code is used for calculate the weight of testing data.Here is the important point of this code:
1, the sample file is testing_result.txt. All data in this should be already processed. Please see the demo1 code for processing code.

2, all the data should be in the same format as in the sample file.

3, the weight will be calculated according to the formular introduced in the report 3 - algorithm part. please see the detailed informaiton from that.

4, this result file will be used for SVM prediction.

5, if the testing data number is much less than trainning data, please include training data in the calculation.
