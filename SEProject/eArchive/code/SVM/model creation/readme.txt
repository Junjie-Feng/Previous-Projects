This is the code for SVM model crateation, the code is written in c++, the sample input file and output file all in the fold.

1, the sample input file (weight file) should be in this sample format

2, the second column in the weight file should be the resut of each data, 0: as watcher group 1: self-involvemetn

3, the model should be used for SVM prediction part.

4, if you wanto change the direction of each file, pleas modify the source code.
