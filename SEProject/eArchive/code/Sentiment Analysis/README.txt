This is the Sentiment Analysis part of our program.

We are using the TextBlob library, so you need to install TextBolb before running our program.

easy install:
$ pip install -U textblob
$ python -m textblob.download_corpora

or you could also use the setup.py in TextBlob-dev folder to intall the library

after that, you could simply run the Seniment.py

Have fun.
